# Tiny Death Star session

## 2022, Friday, August 19th

<!-- I had a normal length session today, doing some elevator trips, restocking, and working on some difficult assignments (assignments that take a very long time to complete, for me, this means 4 weeks or longer) I finished 1 assignment today, but also felt like the game isn't giving me money for the time I was away. I will have to check previous screenshots. !-->

I also have a plan to build all residential floor types before building other floor types (the only exception for this rule is imperial floors) I began construction on a new residential floor today, but the session went slowly, as I was dealing with the common cold during it, along with a lack of sleep. The game glitched out at the very end, and the elevators up button got stuck, and I couldn't get it unstuck without closing the app, so I quit. - 2021 October 15th

I had a very long session again today, and made some progress. I produced some materials, did collection, restocking, tons of elevator trips, and played for nearly an hour.

I now have 100 residents, triple digits. I feared the game glitch that happened last week at the very end, and the elevators up button got stuck, and I couldn't get it unstuck without closing the app. It didn't reoccur today.

I didn't have any Internet at all today. The games currency store has been shut down for years, and I have found that it still attempts to connect, as when I tried to connect, it gave me an error message, rather than looping indefinitely. So it must be tied to some Wi-Fi connection type still, or that is the general message. - 2021 October 22nd

## Graphical notes

Due to my screen resolution (1080x2400) there is a portion of the right of every floor that is not visible during gameplay (since day 1)

Icons 1 and 3 of the floor `Bongos Sandwiches` heavily remind me of an old Fisher Price microwave/oven toy I used to have. I have been meaning to say this for several weeks, but I didn't know where to put it. - 2022, Friday, June 17th

Upon building the `Technician` level (my 48th total floor, 45th when counting only non-Imperial floors, both counts include the lobby as a floor) new elements appeared on top of the death star. - 2022, Friday, July 8th 

## Gameplay notes

While experimenting with quests today, I found that searching for `rebels` is not equivalent to searching for `bitizens` - 2022 July 29th
