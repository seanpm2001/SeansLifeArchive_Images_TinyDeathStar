# TDS Play Style

`Tiny Death Star play style`

## Delivering Bitizens

Residents can be delivered to any negative floor you desire.

By default, I send all non-(?) bitizens And non-VIP bitizens to a needed imperial floor

When I am in need of coins, or there is little time left on imperial construction, I deliver Bitizens elsewhere

By default, I deliver bitizens requesting a floor either the top or second to the top to their preferred location, and I try to always put (?) bitizens to the top floor

## Completing assignments

I try to complete all the assignments before collecting the rewards, so I can collect all 3 rewards at once.

## Tower building

Residential floors go at the bottom, then I go by color right to left, down to up for other floor types to the top.

I try to upgrade everything to either increase the stock for it to last long enough, or for it to farm enough coins.

This game doesn't allow for customization, so I can't do much else.

## Eviction

I typically don't evict my bitizens, unless a quest requires it.

## Imperial Worker VIP

I only use this VIP when there is as much time as possible on an objective as possible.

## Moving levels

I never spend bux to move levels. I use level movers. They come a-plenty, and most of the time, I have more than I need.

## Screenshots

Every interesting change to the gameplay scenario warrants a screenshot. It is like a stop motion video when you go through all of them. It is also part of the documentation process.

Screenshots are like a find the difference game. Sometimes the only difference is the currency counter, but I try to avoid getting more than 1 of these in a row,

This game does not have advertisements in it, so there is no need to archive bad ads here.

## Schedule

This game is played every Friday for 40 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes.

## Big spender VIP

I typically use the Big Spender VIP on the Rebos Karaoke floor, as it has the most stock. If I have big spenders to spare, I will also use them on other floors.

I will never use the big spender on the food floor that has blue milk, as it has the least stock.

## Other

Observe gameplay patterns to find any that I may have missed.
