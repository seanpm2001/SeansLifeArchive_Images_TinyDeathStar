# Tiny Death Star session

## 2021 December 31st

<!-- I had a normal length session today, doing some elevator trips, restocking, and working on some difficult assignments (assignments that take a very long time to complete, for me, this means 4 weeks or longer) I finished 1 assignment today, but also felt like the game isn't giving me money for the time I was away. I will have to check previous screenshots. !-->

I had a very long session again today. I made lots of progress, did elevator trips, restocked, and worked on difficult assignments. I unlocked a 3rd assignment, and it is incredibly difficult. At the current rate, it will take me at least 6 months to finish.

Today, I built a new floor, and also upgraded my elevator, and had an extended session. I upgraded the Mon Cala aquarium twice as well. I did not do any objectives or quests today. - July 16th 2021

I had a very long session again today, and made lots of progress. I produced some materials, did collection, restocking, tons of elevator trips, and played for nearly an hour. I used a few  VIPs today, and earned several imperial bux. I have decided to continue producing materials and earn more money. I intend to complete all 3 objectives on the same day, but I need several more diplomatic envoys first.

I also have a plan to build all residential floor types before building other floor types (the only exception for this rule is imperial floors) I began construction on a new residential floor today, but the session went slowly, as I was dealing with the common cold during it, along with a lack of sleep. The game glitched out at the very end, and the elevators up button got stuck, and I couldn't get it unstuck without closing the app, so I quit. - 2021 October 15th

I had a very long session again today, and made some progress. I produced some materials, did collection, restocking, tons of elevator trips, and played for nearly an hour. I used a few VIPs today, and earned several imperial bux. I finally completed all 3 objectives on the same day today. I also have a plan to build all residential floor types before building other floor types (the only exception for this rule is imperial floors) I began construction on a new residential floor last week, it finished construction last week/6 days ago, and I moved in 5 new residents today. I now have 100 residents, triple digits. I feared the game glitch that happened last week at the very end, and the elevators up button got stuck, and I couldn't get it unstuck without closing the app. It didn't reoccur today.

I didn't have any Internet at all today. The games currency store has been shut down for years, and I have found that it still attempts to connect, as when I tried to connect, it gave me an error message, rather than looping indefinitely. So it must be tied to some Wi-Fi connection type still, or that is the general message. - 2021 October 22nd

I had a very long session again today, and made some progress. I produced some materials, did collection, restocking, tons of elevator trips, and played for nearly an hour. I used a few VIPs today, and earned a few imperial bux. I was paranoid throughout the session that my progress would be erased, similar to the previous game (Virtual City Playground) and also because it really felt like I began building a new residential floor last week, but it wasn't there today. I have a plan to build all residential floor types before building other floor types (the only exception for this rule is imperial floors) - 2021 October 29th
