# Tiny Death Star session August 13th 2021

<!-- I had a normal length session today, doing some elevator trips, restocking, and working on some difficult assignments (assignments that take a very long time to complete, for me, this means 4 weeks or longer) I finished 1 assignment today, but also felt like the game isn't giving me money for the time I was away. I will have to check previous screenshots. !-->

I had a very long session again today. I made lots of progress, did elevator trips, restocked, and worked on difficult assignments. I unlocked a 3rd assignment, and it is incredibly difficult. At the current rate, it will take me at least 6 months to finish.

Today, I built a new floor, and also upgraded my elevator, and had an extended session. I upgraded the Mon Cala aquarium twice as well. I did not do any objectives or quests today. - July 16th 2021
