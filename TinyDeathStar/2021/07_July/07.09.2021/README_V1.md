# Tiny Death Star session July 9th 2021

I had a normal length session today, doing some elevator trips, restocking, and working on some difficult assignments (assignments that take a very long time to complete, for me, this means 4 weeks or longer) I finished 1 assignment today, but also felt like the game isn't giving me money for the time I was away. I will have to check previous screenshots.

## Overview

See above.
