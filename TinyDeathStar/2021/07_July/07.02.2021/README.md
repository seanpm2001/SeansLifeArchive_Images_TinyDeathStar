# Tiny Death Star session July 2nd 2021

I had a normal length session today, doing some elevator trips, restocking, and working on some difficult assignments (assignments that take a very long time to complete, for me, this means 4 weeks or longer) I moved and filled 2 residence floors today, upgraded 1 floor, and completed 1 quest as well today.

## Overview

See above.
