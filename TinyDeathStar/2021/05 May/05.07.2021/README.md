# Tiny Death Star session May 7th 2021

I had a long session today and made some progress towards assignments, and other goals. I slightly regret not having an additional session on May 4th 2021 to celebrate Star Wars day, but I played longer today to try and make up for it.

I began to build 1 new floor, did several elevator trips, did collection, and did restocking.

## Overview

See above.
