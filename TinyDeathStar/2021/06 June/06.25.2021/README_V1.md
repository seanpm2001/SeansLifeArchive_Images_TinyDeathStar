# Tiny Death Star session June 25th 2021

I had a normal length session today, doing many elevator trips, restocking, and working on some difficult assignments (assignments that take a very long time to complete, for me, this means 4 weeks or longer) I decided to build 2 new residential floors today, so that I can clear up 4 VIP spaces, and have more residents. Today, I completed 2 difficult objectives and received 2 more, except one of them is very easy.

## Overview

See above.
